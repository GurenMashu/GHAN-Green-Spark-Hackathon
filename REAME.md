## Project Title
Agri-Smart: Eco-Aware Farming Assistant

## Problem Statement Addressed
"How might we build and deploy technology-driven solutions that actively promote cleaner, greener communities and environmental sustainability?"

## Project Overview
Agri-Smart is an innovative web application aimed at supporting small-scale farmers by tackling the dual challenge of crop diseases and unsustainable farming practices. Using deep learning and machine learning, it provides real-time crop disease identification from a simple photo taken by the user. Once diagnosed, the app offers sustainable, eco-friendly treatment recommendations that reduce dependency on harmful pesticides. 

Additionally, the platform includes a personalized crop and soil recommendation system that guides farmers in selecting resilient and suitable crops for their specific environment. This not only enhances yield but also promotes optimal land use and eco-conscious farming decisions.

By democratizing access to smart agricultural tools, Agri-Smart empowers farmers to adopt sustainable practices, contributing to greener communities and a healthier planet.

## Key Features
- 📷 Instant crop disease detection using CNN
- 🌿 Sustainable, non-chemical treatment suggestions
- 🌾 Crop and soil recommendations using ML-based prediction
- 🧑‍🌾 Simple, farmer-friendly interface for easy accessibility
